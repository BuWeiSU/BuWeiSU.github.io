# About me

Hello, My name is Su Weiheng. I am a master student from [Xi'an Jiaotong University](http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/). I am now a member of the biosemantic group affiliated to [Shaanxi Provincial Key Laboratory of Big Data Knowledge Engineering](https://labs.xjtudlc.com/index.htm). I received my B.S. of computer science from Xi'an Jiaotong University in 2018.

I am looking forward to using AI empowered techiniques to mine beneficial information from [EHRs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_health_record) (Electionic Health Records) to improve real clinical events. My recent reserach focus on medication recommendation for patients.
